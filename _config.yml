  This is Francesca's blog. I'm doing this to understand how Github works!

# social links
twitter_username: your-twitter-handle # DO NOT include the @ character, or else the build will fail!
github_username:  your-github-handle # DO NOT include the @ character, or else the build will fail!

show_excerpts: true # set to false to remove excerpts on the homepage

theme: minima
